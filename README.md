# Code for 'Machine Learning in Natural Language Processing' (5LN708)

This repo contains material I've written for the course 'Machine Learning in Natural Language Processing' (7.5 ects, 5LN708) at Uppsala University. The code here is not intended to be a full course on its own, but is a place where I publish the notebooks I'm giving to the students.

Enrolled students can find slides etc at https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/38289 .
